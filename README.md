# Hackerrank Solution

This is the collection of **algorithms, data structures** and **Statistics** with solutions.
This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in Python and C++/C.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously.   

**Algorithms,  Data Structures** and **Statistics Problems and Solutions** are provided so far.
